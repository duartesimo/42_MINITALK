# 42_MINITALK
Small data exchange program using UNIX signals.

## Project Information
### About

The goal of the Minitalk project is to develop a simple program that allows processes (= programs running on a computer) to communicate with each other using a communication protocol called "minitalk". It corresponds to the protocol that you need to code.
The minitalk communication protocol involves sending messages between two `processes` using a series of `signals` over a single wire. 
One process, called the `"speaker/client"` sends the message by transmitting a series of signals over the wire. 
The other process, called the `"listener/server"` receives the message by interpreting the series of signals as a message.

### Mandatory

- Produce `server` & `client` executables
- `client` must communicate a string passed as a parameter to `server` *(referenced by its process ID)* which then displays it
- Use `SIGUSR1` & `SIGUSR2` signals **ONLY**

### Bonus

- Add reception acknowledgement system
- Support Unicode characters
